# DMIT-2008-OA02 Practical #1

Practical 1 required me to choose/create a product and brand and build and design a CRUD page linked to a Firebase RTD.

## Description

I created the brand Hinode Apparel. My site was built with vanilla html, css, and javascript. Products already stored in the RTD are displayed to the user on initial load of the index.html, the user can then choose to add a new product to the page and RTD, delete products from the page and RTD, or modify any of the currently loaded products data on the page and RTD.

### Dependencies

* Firebase NPM
* Parcel NPM

### Installing

* In order to make this function with your database you will have to add in your own firebase configuration keys to the .env file.


### Executing program

* To run dev server:
```
npx parcel src/index.html
```
